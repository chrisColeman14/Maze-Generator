# Maze-Generator
This program allows a user to customize the dimension of maze and it be randomly generated based on the parameters of the user. It also can then solve the maze while telling you how much of the maze had to be traversed to get to the end.

Maze Generator allows the user to determine the width and height of the maze and allows you to customize the speed at which the program solves the maze. It uses the first depth search algorithm to both create the maze and to solve it. To use the program the user just has to generate the maze they want then all they have to do is press the solve button to allow the program to solve the maze.
